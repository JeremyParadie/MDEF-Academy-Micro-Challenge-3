### Story Generator

[Procedual Web Story Generator](/web_geist.py)

The story generator tells a story based on the keywords: 

>>Once upon a time, there was a beautiful kingdom made entirely of books. The shelves were lined with all sorts of stories, from classic fairytales to modern-day adventures. The people of this kingdom loved to read, and they would often spend hours curled up with their favorite book.\n\nOne day, a terrible storm swept through the kingdom, destroying everything in its path. All of the books were blown away, and the once- lively kingdom was left in ruins.\n\nThe people of the kingdom were heartbroken. They didn't know what to do without their beloved books. But then, one day, a strange woman appeared and said she could help them. She had magical powers that could bring the books back to life.\n\nWith the woman's help, the kingdom was soon restored to its former glory. And everyone lived happily ever after surrounded by their favorite stories once again."
